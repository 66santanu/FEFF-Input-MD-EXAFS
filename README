### by making coordinate transform to place the absorbing atom 
### at the center and rearranging all other atoms  
### in order from closest to the farthest
### For any other input parameters Documentation of FEFF9 should be consulted

### Running for a single snapshot (see the example directory)
1. You should have the the XYZ structure file present where you run it. Name it as "Structure.xyz"
2. Execute: feffInp <input-para, where input-para contains all the inpur parameters

### Running for a trajectory
 Use the script "do_run_for_traj" located under example/for-a-trajectory/ to generate feff.inp for each configuration
